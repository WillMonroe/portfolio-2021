	<p>In local Detroit neighborhoods (Fitzgerald, Brightmoor, Osborn, Warrendale, etc.) 60 
	percent of children under 5 live in poverty. Due to this dire circumstance most of these children 
	are not ready for kindergarten. By the time the child reaches the third grade only 14 percent read 
	at grade level. In addition, 30,000 of the kids in Detroit are not provided with learning or care 
	options now or in the near future. In the pursuit of designing a solution for increasing childhood 
	literacy; I have created a prototype for a website that will enable children in Detroit to become 
	better equipped with the tools they need to succeed at the next level academically. .</p>
